# Shopping-organiser
This is a shopping organiser which helps build shopping lists for a whole week in order to know exactly what you will be eating during the days of a week. 
Its main goal is to help you avoid being caught by surprise during the day with the questions that we're all facing at some point: What should I eat? Do I need to go shopping again?
Not only will it help you with a list of meals but it will also help you avoid eating out (saving money this way 💰 🙋‍♂️) in those days when you didn't plan ahead for a proper meal.
